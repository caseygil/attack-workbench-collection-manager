## DEPRECATED

As of v2.0.0, the ATT&CK Workbench Collection Manager has been deprecated. All functionality of the Collection Manager has been absorbed into the [ATT&CK Workbench REST API](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api).

<hr>

# ATT&CK Workbench Collection Manager

The ATT&CK Workbench is an application allowing users to **explore**, **create**, **annotate**, and **share** extensions of the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base. 

This repository contains the REST API and services for managing collections, collection indexes, and collection subscriptions. It is a Node.js application extending the functionality of the [ATT&CK Workbench REST API](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api) with collection-management services.

The ATT&CK Workbench application requires additional components for full operation. The [ATT&CK Workbench Frontend](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend) repository contains the full documentation of the scope and function of the project. See the [install and run](#install-and-run) instructions for more details about setting up the entire project.

## Collection Manager Documentation

When running with the NODE_ENV environment variable set to `development`, the app hosts a description of the Collection Manager using the Swagger UI module.
The Collection Manager documentation can be viewed using a browser at the path `/api-docs`.

For a basic installation on the local machine this documentation can be accessed at `http://localhost:3001/api-docs`.

The [docs](/docs/README.md) folder contains additional documentation about using the Collection Manager:
- [standalone docker installation](/docs/docker.md): instructions for setting up the Collection Manager via docker. Note that this is not the same as the full [ATT&CK Workbench Docker Installation](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend/blob/master/docs/docker-compose.md).
- [contributing](/docs/contributing.md): information about how to contribute to this project.

## Install and run

The ATT&CK Workbench application is made up of several repositories. For the full application to operate each needs to be running at the same time. The [docker install instructions](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend/blob/master/docs/docker-compose.md) will install all components and is recommended for most deployments.
- [ATT&CK Workbench Frontend](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend) 
  
  The front-end user interface for the ATT&CK Workbench tool, and the primary interface through which the knowledge base is accessed.
- [ATT&CK Workbench REST API](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api)

  REST API service for storing, querying and editing ATT&CK objects.
- [ATT&CK Workbench Collection Manager](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-collection-manager)  (this repository)

  REST API and services for managing collections, collection indexes, and collection subscriptions. 
  
  The collection manager is **not** required to be installed to use the ATT&CK Workbench, but is highly recommended. If you opt not to install the collection-manager you will not be able to import or export data from your local knowledge base. If the collection manager is not installed, set `integrations.collection_manager.enabled` to `false` in the front-end environment. See [modifying the environment](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend#modifying-the-environment) for more details.

The manual install instructions in each repository describe how each component to be deployed to a separate machine or with customized settings. 

### Installing using Docker
Please refer to our [Docker install instructions](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-frontend/blob/master/docs/docker-compose.md) for information on installing and deploying the app using Docker. The docker setup is the easiest way to deploy the application.

### Manual Installation

#### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version `18.12.1` or greater

#### Installation

##### Step 1. Clone the git repository

```
git clone git@github.com:center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-collection-manager.git
cd attack-workbench-collection manager
```

##### Step 2. Install the dependencies

The ATT&CK Workbench Collection Manager installs all dependencies within the project.
It doesn't depend on the global installation of any modules.

```
npm install
```

##### Step 3. Configure the system

The app can be configured using environment variables, a configuration file, or a combination of these methods.
Note that any values set in a configuration file take precedence over values set using environment variables.

###### Using Environment Variables

| name                            | required | default                 | description                                                        |
|---------------------------------|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PORT**                        | no       | `3001`                  | Port the HTTP server should listen on                              |
| **ENABLE_CORS_ANY_ORIGIN**      | no       | `true`                  | Allows requests from any domain to access the REST API endpoints   |
| **NODE_ENV**                    | no       | `development`           | Environment that the app is running in                             |
| **WORKBENCH_REST_API_BASE_URL** | no       | `http://localhost:3000` | Base URL for the [ATT&CK Workbench REST API](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api)  |
| **CHECK_WORKBENCH_INTERVAL**    | no       | `10`                    | The frequency in seconds of synchronization with the [ATT&CK Workbench REST API](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-workbench-rest-api)   |
| **JSON_CONFIG_PATH**            | no       | ``                      | Location of a JSON file containing configuration values            |

###### Using a Configuration File

If the `JSON_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is set, the app will also read configuration settings from a JSON file at that location.

| name                                 | type     | corresponding environment variable |
|--------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------|
| **server.port**                      | int      | PORT                               |
| **server.enableCorsAnyOrigin**       | boolean  | ENABLE_CORS_ANY_ORIGIN             |
| **app.env**                          | string   | NODE_ENV                           |
| **workbench.restApiBaseUrl**         | string   | WORKBENCH_REST_API_BASE_URL        |
| **scheduler.checkWorkbenchInterval** | int      | CHECK_WORKBENCH_INTERVAL           |

Sample configuration file setting the server port and database url:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "port": 4001
  },
  "workbench": {
    "restApiBaseUrl": "http://localhost:4000"
  },
  "scheduler": {
    "checkWorkbenchInterval": 60
  }
}
```

##### Step 4. Run the app

```
node ./bin/www
```

## Scripts

`package.json` contains a number of scripts that can be used to perform recurring tasks.

### JavaScript Linter

Use the command:

`npm run lint`

to run ESLint on the codebase.

### Validate Module Versions

Use the command

`npm run snyk`

to run the Snyk validator on the currently installed modules.
This will check the modules for known security flaws.

Note that this requires the `SNYK_TOKEN` environment variable to be set to a valid Snyk token to run.
